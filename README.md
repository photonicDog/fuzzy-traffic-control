# fuzzy-traffic-control
A basic traffic control using fuzzy logic for my FLOTA assignment.

This includes:
* fuzzytraffic.py, the fuzzy logic control system
* binarytraffic.py, the fixed-time control system
* testfuzzy.py, an isolation of the fuzzy control set (run to get a 3D visualisation)
* test_data folder, for test data from the project
